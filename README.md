# Airbnb Price Prediction

This repository is the work for my first project from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program where I analyzed the dataset from Airbnb and provide some interesting insights about price-prediction models.

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

The code is saved in `.ipynb` file and can be run with any tool that support this file format.
These are libraries that is used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- xgboost
- geopandas

### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project aims to answer these questions:

1. How is the price distributed in different areas?
2. How do different models predict the house price?
3. How to improve the prediction result?

### Results <a name="results"></a>

For the code, please check the notebook `price_prediction.ipynb`.

The findings of this project has been published [here](https://medium.com/@d.huy723/clustering-helps-to-improve-price-prediction-in-online-booking-systems-3aab0e2dc83b).

### Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>

This project use data from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) (London 2019). To download the dataset used in this project, check this drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XwK4Z6vm7OFdrAWySAcbIv8Me0YEB6Gc?usp=sharing).
